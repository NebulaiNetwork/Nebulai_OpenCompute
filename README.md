## Nebulai Open Compute
nebulai's depin computing services

## 🚀 Overview  
**OpenCompute** is Nebulai’s decentralized computing platform, designed to power scalable, distributed workloads across a permissionless network of contributors.

We are building the foundation for a truly decentralized compute layer — efficient, transparent, and available to everyone.

## 📢 Notice

The current release of OpenCompute is now **open source**.  
We have released two key components of the system:

- **OpenCompute User Module** – the client interface for submitting and managing compute tasks  
- **OpenCompute Worker Module** – the execution node responsible for running compute workloads  

Explore the repositories:

> ⚠️ Please note: OpenCompute remains under active development.  
> The current version reflects an MVP and may differ from future stable releases.
