## Nebulai Open Compute
nebulai's depin computing services

## 🚀 Overview
**OpenCompute** is Nebulai’s next-generation decentralized computing network, engineered to deliver elastic, distributed processing power with zero infrastructure overhead.

Unlike traditional systems, OpenCompute introduces a truly plug-and-play architecture:

**Workers** can contribute computing power instantly — simply by opening a browser, no installation required.

**Users** can tap into global compute resources through a lightweight Python SDK, without managing any backend.

We're redefining the boundaries of accessible computing — frictionless, serverless, and permissionless.
This is not just a platform — it's the foundation of a new computational paradigm, built for scale, built for everyone.

## 📢 Notice

The current release of OpenCompute is now **open source**.  
We have released two key components of the system:

- **OpenCompute User Module** – the client interface for submitting and managing compute tasks  
- **OpenCompute Worker Module** – the execution node responsible for running compute workloads  

Explore the repositories:

🔗 [OpenCompute Worker Module](https://github.com/NebulaiNetwork/OpenCompute_Worker)

> ⚠️ Please note: OpenCompute remains under active development.  
> The current version reflects an MVP and may differ from future stable releases.
